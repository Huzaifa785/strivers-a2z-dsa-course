## 1st january 2025: patterns part 8

---

9th pattern of the series. i was not active for almost a week, and man this wasn't expected, i went off straight for 7-8 days, and i hope i don't do this now.

q9.

```

printing this pattern wasn't that complex, at first i thought i'll have to use break, continue sort of stuff, but then after watching the video, i realised, ah, i just need to call both functions of the earlier two patterns and we are done.

wrapping up 1st january 2026 and see you tomorrow!
